# SOIL_CLASSIFICATION_ML_MODEL

This repository contains the code and resources for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed to classify soil images into three categories: Gravel, Sand, and Silt. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras and incorporates data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance robustness and accuracy.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately classify soil images into the specified categories. The project includes:

Model Development: A CNN model was trained to classify soil images into Gravel, Sand, and Silt categories. The model architecture and hyperparameters were carefully selected to optimize performance.

Data Augmentation: To increase the model's robustness, data augmentation was applied using the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras. This technique helped the model generalize better by generating varied versions of the input images during training.

Model Training: The model was trained on a labeled dataset of soil images, using TensorFlow and Keras for efficient and scalable deep learning.

Deployment and Testing: The trained model was deployed to classify new soil images. The results include percentage-based classifications and visualizations to provide clear insights into the predictions. The model was tested extensively with various images to ensure accurate predictions and practical application.
